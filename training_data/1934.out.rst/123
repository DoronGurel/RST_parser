the drug,

11
 called FK-506,

elaboration-additional-e

 could revolutionize the transplantation field
5008

13
 by reducing harmful side effects

 and by lowering rejection rates.

 Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants

 performed world-wide each year.

 Researchers began using the drug in February on patients

 Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected.

 We're shocked by it,

FK-506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine,

 They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506,

 compared with cyclosporine,
