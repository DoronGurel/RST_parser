 At age eight, Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman's house 
5001

to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep 
5002

-- a place in the basement with the coal.

 At age 19, she was a Paris sensation,

 It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas.

 Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters.
5006

8
 And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.

9
 Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions,

but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.

Comparison

17
 Men were a constant complication.
5016

18
 Baker had lots of them.

19
 But she didn't trust them 
5018
List

20
and didn't reward trust.

21
 As she saw one key love affair,

24
 Her appetite for children also was large.

25
 She adopted 12 of assorted races,

 She made money,

Friends pitched in.

 Finally, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco.

 Another lifelong complication,

 Baker had the good luck 
5036
span

38
to arrive in 1925 Paris,
5037
span

39
 where blacks had become exotic.
38
elaboration-object-attribute-e

40
 African art was in vogue 
5039
List

41
and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age

42
to be inspired by blacks.
41
elaboration-additional

43
 To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized,
5043
span

44
 but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.
43
elaboration-additional

45
 Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, 
5044
span

46
where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line 
5045
span

47
(performing of course for all-white audiences).
46
elaboration-additional

48
 Paris loved her at first sight.
5046

 She just wiggled her fanny

 Ms. Rose,

5053
Same-Unit

57
claiming 
5056

58
that Baker's dancing had uncovered a new region for desire 
5056

59

58
consequence-s

60
 Jazz Cleopatra contains other, more important, false notes 
5057
span

61
that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.
60
elaboration-object-attribute-e

62
 It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit 
5058

63
who broke many of the restraints

convention places on women,

 Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.

67
 Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.

 To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.

 Baker was 68 years old
5070

 when she died in Paris, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show:

a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life.

In fact, Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca 
5072

74
 During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion

that the Nazis were evil
