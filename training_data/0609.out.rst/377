 Not so fast,

 I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century,

10
 It's the line-item veto, a procedure 
5012

11
that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill

 passed by Congress

13
 without vetoing the entire bill.

 Whatever one thinks of the idea,
5013
comment

15
 it's far more than the budgetary gimmick 
5013
span

16
it may seem at first glance.
15
elaboration-object-attribute-e

17
 Rather, it's a device 
5017

that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress,

 President Bush badly wants a line-item veto
5022
List

23
 and has long called for a law 
5021
span

24
giving it to the president.
23
elaboration-object-attribute-e

25
 Now the White House is declaring 
5026
attribution

26
that he might not rely on Congress 
5025
span

27
-- which hasn't shown any willingness
5024
span

28
 to surrender such authority --
27
elaboration-object-attribute-e

 to pass the line-item veto law 
5023

he seeks.

elaboration-object-attribute-e

31
 White House spokesmen last week said
5032
attribution

32
 Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring 
33
attribution

33
that the Constitution gives him the power,
5031
span

34
 exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge 
5030
span

35
to decide 
36
attribution

36
whether he has the right.
5029
span

37
 Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington,
38
concession

38
 it would set off a political earthquake.
5034
span

39
 The ramifications are enormous, 
5036
span

40
says Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat
5035
span

41
 who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee.
40
elaboration-additional-e

42
 It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress.
5036
elaboration-additional

43
 White House aides know 
5041
attribution

44
it's a step 
5040
span

45
that can't be taken lightly 
44
elaboration-object-attribute-e

46
-- and for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year.

 Some senior advisers argue

that

 with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming,
50
circumstance-e

50
 Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress.
5043
span

51
 They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year.
5046
span

52
 Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea
5048
span

53
 of trying out a line-item veto.
52
elaboration-object-attribute-e

54
 The issue arose last week 
5050
temporal-same-time

55
when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago 
56
attribution

56
that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case.
5050
span

57
 White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed
58
attribution

58
 that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea,
5054
span

59
 but cautioned 
5052
attribution

60
that there wasn't a firm decision 
5052
span

61
to try it.
60
elaboration-object-attribute-e

62
 Mr. Bush, former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing 
5060
attribution

63
that a line-item veto would go a long way 
5060
span

64
in restoring discipline to the budget process.
63
elaboration-object-attribute-e

65
 They maintain
5063
attribution

66
 that a president needs the ability 
5063
span

67
to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects 
5062
span

68
that are attached to big omnibus spending bills.
5067
span

69
 Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety 
5066
span

70
because they often are needed 
5065
span

71
to keep the government operating.
70
purpose

72
 Conservatives note 
5069
attribution

73
that 43 governors have the line-item veto 
5069
span

74
to use on state budgets.
73
elaboration-object-attribute-e

75
 More provocatively, some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing
5073
attribution

76
 that Mr. Bush doesn't need to wait for a law
5072
span

77
 giving him the veto
76
elaboration-object-attribute-e

78
 because the power already is implicit in the Constitution.
5072
reason

79
 They base their argument on a clause 
5085
span

80
buried in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution 
79
elaboration-additional-e

81
that states:
5085
elaboration-object-attribute-e

82
 Every order, resolution, or vote 
5082
span

83
to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary 
5081

84
(except on a question of adjournment)
83
elaboration-additional-e

85
 shall be presented to the President of the United States;
5083
Same-Unit

86
 and
5080
Same-Unit

87
 before the same shall take effect,
5078
temporal-before-e

88
 shall be approved by him 
5078
Disjunction

89
or . . . disapproved by him. . . .
5078
Disjunction

90
 This clause,
5091
span

91
 they argue,
90
attribution-e

92
 is designed to go beyond an earlier clause 
5090
span

93
specifying 
94
attribution

94
that the president can veto a bill,
5089
span

95
 and is broad enough 
96
consequence-n

96
to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills.
5088
span

97
 Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole 
5187
span

98
(R., Kan.),
97
elaboration-additional-e

99
 for one, accepts this argument
5096
Same-Unit

100
 and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide 
101
attribution

101
whether or not it is constitutional.
5094
span

102
 There's little doubt
5103
span

103
 that such a move would be immediately challenged in court
5102
span

104
 -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court
5101
span

105
 to be ultimately resolved.
104
purpose

106
 It's a major issue,
107
reason

107
 and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level, 
5108
span

108
says Stephen Glazier, a New York attorney 
5105
span

109
whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea 
5104
span

110
that a president already has a line-item veto.
109
elaboration-object-attribute-e

111
 Rep. Edwards, the California Democrat, is one 
5113
span

112
who pledges
113
attribution

113
 that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts,
5112
span

114
 arguing 
5110
attribution

115
a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything
5110
span

116
 the framers of the Constitution had in mind.
115
elaboration-object-attribute-e

117
 It puts this president in the legislative business, 
5115
span

118
he declares.
117

119
 That's not what our fathers had in mind.
5115
comment

120
 In addition to giving a president powers 
5119
span

121
to rewrite spending bills 
5118
span

122
meant to be written in Congress,
121
elaboration-object-attribute-e

123
 Rep. Edwards argues,
5119
attribution

124
 a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers.
5131
span

125
 He notes 
5122
attribution

126
that, as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area, he fights each year 
5122
span

127
to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.
126
purpose

128
 If a president had a line-item veto
5127
List

129
 and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative,
5127
List

130
 Rep. Edwards says,
5127
attribution

131
 the president could call
5126
Sequence

132
 and declare 
5124
attribution

133
that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds 
5124
span

134
unless the congressman shapes up on the foreign-policy issue.
133
condition

135
 Proponents maintain 
136
attribution

136
that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that.
5134
span

137
 But there may be another problem with the device:
5137
span

138
 Despite all the political angst
5135
span

139
 it would cause,
138
elaboration-object-attribute-e

140
 it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit.
5136
span

141
 Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected.
5136
elaboration-additional

142
 Governors have found 
5141
attribution

143
that they have to use the device sparingly 
5141
span

144
to maintain political comity.
143
purpose

145
 And it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto
5145
span

146
 because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports
5144
span

147
 accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves.
146
elaboration-object-attribute-e

148
 Still, proponents contend 
149
attribution

149
that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important chilling effect on all manner of appropriations bills.
5147
span

150
 Lawmakers,
5149
span

151
 they say,
150
attribution-e

152
 would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment
5148
span

153
 of having them singled out for a line-item veto later.
152
elaboration-object-attribute-e

154
 Whatever the outcome of a test case, President Bush would have to move cautiously
5155
span

155
 becase the very attempt would antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans,
154
reason

156
 says Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service
5154
span

157
 who specializes in executive-legislative relations.
156
elaboration-object-attribute-e

158
 Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in the way 
5157
span

159
the system works, 
158
elaboration-object-attribute-e

160
he notes.
5157

 Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto,

162
 some,

 ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards
