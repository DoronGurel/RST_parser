Title

 TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits 
5001
span

3
that store data 
5002
span

4
even when the power is off.
3
concession

5
 Today's most widely used data-storing chips have volatile memories 
5004
span

6
-- their data disappear 
5003
span

7
if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity,
6
condition

8
 so they need external power supplies.
5004
consequence-s

9
 National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up 
5006
span

10
named Ramtron Corp.
9
elaboration-object-attribute-e

11
 plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories, 
5009
span

12
which can remember data for at least 10 years 
5015
span

13
without any current flowing to them.
12
circumstance

14
 The chips use materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, 
5012
span

15
to form microscopic switches 
5013
span

16
that retain their data 
5014
span

17
without electricity.
16
circumstance

18
 Developers caution 
5018
attribution

19
that broad applications are several years away 
5018
span

20
because the technology isn't fully refined.
19
explanation-argumentative

21
 But Ramtron of Colorado Springs, Colo., plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December.
5020
hypothetical

22
 The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices 
5020
span

23
that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, 
5124
span

24
including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives.
23
example-e

25
 National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque, N.M. 
5028
span

26
National says 
5025
attribution

27
it agreed to acquire Krysalis's assets 
5025
Sequence

28
and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, 
5122
span

29
including a 4-kilobit memory, 
28
example-e

30
next year.
5027
Same-Unit

31
 Once production hurdles are overcome, 
32
circumstance

32
the chips could take over a significant part of the market.
5029
span

33
 In addition to not needing an outside power source, 
5031
elaboration-additional

34
they are potentially cheaper to make 
5031
span

35
because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips.
34
explanation-argumentative

36
 Military buyers have shown interest, 
5034
span

37
National says, 
36
attribution

38
because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation.
5035
Consequence

39
 And 
5041
Same-Unit

40
while today's non-volatile chips 
5037
span

41
-- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- 
40
example-e

42
can't be used in a computer's central memory 
5038
Same-Unit

43
because they learn data slowly, 
5038
explanation-argumentative

44
ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds.

47
 AN AUSTIN, Texas, company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away 
5046
span

48
without leaving town.
47
concession

49
 Witnesses often must travel long distances 
5047
span

50
to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters.
49
purpose

51
 That means huge travel bills.
5047
consequence-s

52
 And telephone or videotape depositions just don't match physical encounters.
5049
List

53
 That could change, thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics.

54
 Video Telecom Corp., 
5051
span

55
which markets videoconferencing systems, 
54

5052
Same-Unit

57
to wire a nationwide network 
5054

57
purpose

59
 The company installed a prototype system 
5056
span

60
that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines.
59
elaboration-object-attribute-e

61
 And it is preparing to set up shop in Chicago, New York and 10 other cities 
5058
span

62
where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network.
61
elaboration-object-attribute-e

63
 While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before, 
64
concession

64
the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper.
5060
span

65
 An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $200 and $400,

 Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection

 JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers.
5070
span

70
 Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables.
5074
span

71
 Until now, most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them.
5073
Contrast

72
 But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan's electronics industry 
5072
span

73
when it accused Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology 
5071

74

73
purpose

75
 (A settlement was reached 
5075
Contrast

76
but wasn't made public.) 
5075

77
And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S.'s Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit 
5077

78
charging 
79
attribution

that Motorola's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent.
5078

80
 Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology 
5080
Contrast

81
-- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers.
5080

82
 The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection 
5084

that 
5082

84
patent experts say

85
Japan is starting to take.
5083
Same-Unit

86
 Hitachi made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim 
5087

87
filed in a federal district court in Texas

88
 after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation.
