 Not surprisingly, she quickly adapted to the American way.

 Three months after she arrived in L.A.

 she spent $120

 Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News,

 the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair's gossipy archness and Premiere's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae, with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter.

 It's being sold through bookstores, newsstands and some video stores.

 Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev,

33
 Now, for example, she owns 48 hats.
5042

34
 However, she remembers the lean years

 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her

 You have to be born with it.

 I used to wear hats in Russia,

circumstance

55
 but I had to make them and my dresses.
5053
span

56
 On the hat side I wasn't getting what I wanted.

reason

57
 Now 48 years old, Ms. Volokh has definite ideas
5058
span

58
 about what she wants.
57
elaboration-object-attribute-e

59
 At Movieline, she wants specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude

60
-- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek.

61
 In restaurants

 (in this case, the Russian Samovar, a New York restaurant

62
elaboration-object-attribute-e

64
 she didn't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room.

 Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes

73
she was born with:
5070
span

74
 an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties.

 Parties are rather a state of mind,

 Even in Russia we managed to give parties.

5087

93
 I like rather tea,

94
 because it is at the end of the day.
93
reason

95
 She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m.

 It's supposed to be later

 In Los Angeles, it's important to catch people just after work.

120
 the editorial people think is impossible,
