 Twenty years ago, in the infancy of suburban sprawl, just a handful of dealerships were here.

Contrast

 Now there are 23.

 Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge are nameplates

 The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America, in everything from phone companies to colas.

 Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars, vans and trucks, up from just 408

21
 For car marketers, it has become a much tougher battle 
5021

22
to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block.

purpose

23
 For American car buyers, the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing.
5023

24
 Malcolm MacDougall, vice chairman of the Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York, calls the proliferation nameplate mania.

List

25
 He says 
5025

26
the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today,

and that people will simply ignore new models

 The winners,

will be brands from car makers

 He says

34
it's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible

while still retaining links to the parent company's quality image.

temporal-same-time

36
 He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. 
5036
span

37
for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models,

Contrast

38
rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines.
5037
Contrast

39
 Some auto executives believe 
40
attribution

40
the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks. 
5039

41
There's more noise out there, 
5041
List

42
and the consumer may have to work harder 
5042

43
to cut through it, 
42
purpose

44
says Vincent P. Barabba, executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp.

 But the reward is that there's less need to make tradeoffs

 Jeanene Page, of North Salt Lake City, Utah, likes the broader selection.

 Now, the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van,

that it's just the thing

to haul nine grandchildren

and pull a boat at the same time.

 Market segmentation in cars isn't new, 
5058
span

59
but it's far more extensive 
5059

60
than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago.

61
 The legendary GM chairman declared 
62

that his company would make a car for every purse and purpose.
5061

 Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose.

 Just four years ago, GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments.
5064
Contrast

65
 Today, they identify 19 distinct segments for cars, and another 11 for trucks and vans.
5064
Contrast

66
 The number of makes has mushroomed 
5066

67
because the U.S. is the world's biggest and richest market for automobiles;

reason

68
virtually every auto maker wants to sell here.

For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits.

85
 Which cars do Americans favor most these days?

86
 It's hard to generalize, 
5085

87
but age seems to be the best predictor.
86

88
 Adults under age 30 like sports cars, luxury cars, convertibles and imports far more 
5087

89
than their elders do.

 Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car,

 Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37% to 28% margin

Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back,

just as it was possible to lose them.

 The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip.

 GM's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model,

Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today's.

 Americans spent more than $190 billion on new cars and trucks last year,
