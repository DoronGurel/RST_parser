 Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order

 Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties

 Some highly publicized cases 
5013

14
involving RICO TROs 
13
elaboration-object-attribute-e

15
have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press,
5014
Same-Unit

16
 because of a perception 
5016
span

17
that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.

18
 In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected,
5019
purpose

19
 the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements
5019
span

20
 to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions.

21
 (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office.):

comment

 1. As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
5022
span

23
 The prosecutor must show 
5025
attribution

24
that less-intrusive remedies 
5024
span

25
(such as bonds)
24
example-e

26
 are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction.
5025
Same-Unit

27
 2. In seeking approval of a TRO, 
5027
circumstance

28
the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact
5028
span

29
 that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties,
28
elaboration-object-attribute-e

30
 balanced against the government's need
5029
span

31
 to preserve the assets.
30
elaboration-object-attribute-e

32
 3. In deciding whether forfeiture 
5032
span

33
(and, hence, a TRO)
32
elaboration-additional-e

34
 is appropriate,
5031
Same-Unit

35
 the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense;
5033
span

36
 the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law
5034
span

37
 where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.
36
circumstance

38
 4. When a RICO TRO is being sought, 
5036
circumstance

39
the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly 
5037
attribution

40
that the government's request for a TRO, and eventual forfeiture, is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties 
5037
span

41
-- that is, 
5044
Same-Unit

42
in requesting the TRO, 
5038
circumstance-e

43
the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant;
5038
List

44
 will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets 
5039
span

45
legitimately transferred to them; 
44
elaboration-object-attribute-e

46
will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions
5040
span

47
 occurring between the defendant and third parties; 
46
elaboration-object-attribute-e

48
and will, in all other respects, assist the court 
5042
span

49
in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected,
5043
span

50
 through proceeding under {RICO} and otherwise. 
49
means

51
 The Division expects 
52
attribution

52
that the prosecutor will announce these principles
5046
span

53
 either at the time the indictment is returned or, at the latest, at the first proceeding before the court 
5048
span

54
concerning the TRO.
