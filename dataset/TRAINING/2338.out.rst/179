 has signaled

that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s 
5004
span

5
as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity.

circumstance

 In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants,

and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.

 GM is under intense pressure 
5008

to close factories

11
as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.

 The company,

currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity,

has vowed

it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.

Just a month ago, GM announced

it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility

 Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation 
5019
span

20
to get in shape for the 1990s.
19
purpose

21
 One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. 
5021
span

22
that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower 
5022
span

23
than GM can match.

24
 Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled 
5025

25
they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract
5025

26
 that will be negotiated next year.

 GM officials want to get their strategy

in place 
5028

before those talks begin.

31
 The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time 
5031
span

32
when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents 
5032
span

33
who charge
34

34
 the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.
5033
span

35
 Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich,
5035
span

36
 who recently became head of the union's GM department,
35
elaboration-object-attribute-e

37
 issued a statement Friday 
5037

38
blasting GM's flagrant insensitivity toward union members.

 The auto maker's decision 
5039
span

40
to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants

41
showed disarray and an inability or unwillingness

Mr. Yokich said.

 GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves: 
5044
span

45
 Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.
5045
span

46
 That means two plants 
5046
span

47
-- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio -- 
46
elaboration-general-specific-e

48
probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.
5047

 The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.

 Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown

52
 But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move

 GM is studying

whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec,

the facility was asked to draw up plans

the plant has no new product

81
 At Pontiac, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes

82
that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant 
5082
span

83
that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater Pontiac Fiero model.

 The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM

before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.
5084
Sequence

86
 Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result.

87
 Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure.
