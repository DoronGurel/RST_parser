 Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday

as America West Airlines announced

it will postpone its new service out of Houston

 Peter Otradovec, vice president for planning at the Phoenix, Ariz., carrier, said in an interview

7
that the work stoppage at Boeing,

8
now entering its 13th day,

Boeing told America West 
5016
attribution

16
that the 757

17
it was supposed to get this Thursday 
16
elaboration-object-attribute-e

18
wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 
5017

19
-- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights, 
5018

20
including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas.

elaboration-set-member-e

21
 Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan. 
5014
consequence-s

22
 Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year's end.
5024
span

23
 Those, too, are almost certain to arrive late.
22
interpretation-s

24
 At this point, no other America West flights 
5026
span

25
-- including its new service at San Antonio, Texas; Newark, N.J.; and Palmdale, Calif. -- 
24
example-e

26
have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries.
5027
Same-Unit

27
 Nevertheless, the company's reaction underscores the domino effect 
5029
span

28
that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy.
27
elaboration-object-attribute-e

29
 It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company.

30
 I just don't feel

that the company can really stand

34
 I don't think

35
their customers would like it very much.
5035
span

36
 America West, though, is a smaller airline 
5047
consequence-n

37
and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane 
5047
span

38
than many of its competitors would be. 
37
comparison

39
I figure 
5137

40
that American and United probably have such a hard time 
5049

41
counting all the planes in their fleets, 
40
manner

42
they might not miss one at all, 
5137
span

43
Mr. Otradovec said.
5051

44
 Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate 
45

45
that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.

 Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300

 In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman explained

 Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft

 it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders.

 The market has taken two views:

 Still,

93
it's possible that the strike could last considerably longer.

94
 I wouldn't expect an immediate resolution to anything.

comment

95
 Last week, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter,
5107
span

96
 saying 
97
attribution

97
that to my knowledge, Boeing's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history.
5108
span

98
 But Mr. Baker called the letter 
5109
span

99
-- and the company's offer of a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus bonuses -- 
98

100
very weak.

Same-Unit

 He added
