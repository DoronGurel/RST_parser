 With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, 
2
circumstance

2
many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.

3
 They expected a new barrage of demands 
5003

that Japan do something quickly 
5002

to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S.

purpose-e

6
 Instead, they got a discussion of the need

7
for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.

 Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
5011

9
 Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices 
5007
span

10
that supposedly inhibit free trade.

 He said

such results should be measurable in dollars and cents

in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

 But Mrs. Hills, 
5012

15
speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, 
14
elaboration-additional-e

16
stressed 
5014

17
that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, 
18
preference

it is rather to have a blueprint for action.
5014

 She added 
5017

that she expected perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step 
5017

21
to convince the American people and the Japanese people 
22
attribution

22
that we're moving in earnest. 
5016
span

23
 How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months. 
5019
comment

24
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills. 
5027
span

25
Many called it simply a contrast in styles. 
5026
List

26
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.

the Bush administration may feel

29
the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.

30
And some said 
5024
attribution

31
it reflected the growing debate in Washington 
5024

32
over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.

 Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's,

Mrs. Hills replied:

35
I didn't hear every word 
5029
span

36
he spoke,
35
elaboration-object-attribute-e

37
 but as a general proposition, 
5089
span

38
I think

39
we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration.

her tone often was surprisingly conciliatory.

 I think

my line has been very consistent,

46
Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. 
5037
attribution

47
I am painted sometimes as ferocious,
5039
span

48
 perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes 
5040

49
to implement. 
48
elaboration-object-attribute-e

50
I don't feel very ferocious. 
5093

51
I don't feel either hard or soft.

I feel committed to the program

54
 When she met the local press for the first time on Friday, 
5055
circumstance

55
Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress 
5055
span

56
in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas 
5054
span

57
targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill. 
56

58
She highlighted exclusionary business practices 
5056
span

59
that the U.S. government has identified. 
58

60
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition. 
5060

61
She said 
5057
attribution

62
the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors

65
 At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief. 
5067

66
My impression was that you would be a scary old lady,

But I am relieved to see 
70

that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity. 
5065

71
 Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, 
5069
span

72
about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market. 
71
elaboration-object-attribute-e

73
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years. 
5075
Comparison

Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement

75
as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991,

76
but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.

 At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said,

 I believe

we can do much better than 20%.

80
But she stressed,

81
I am against managed trade.

I will not enter into an agreement
