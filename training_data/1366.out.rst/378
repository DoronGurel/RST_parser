 Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties.

 The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.

 As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L

Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility

 Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report

 All the senators say

they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent.

 Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix,

 But at the same time, Mr. Gonzalez hasn't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer.
5119
span

98
 The Senate negotiators included Sens. Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall's principal sponsor, Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah.
5123
span

99
 They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation 
5121
span

100
to preserve Mr. Wall's job 
5120

101
and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing 
5122

102
in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L.

103
 Most importantly, the Senate traded away the Bush administration's controversial plan

104
to finance the bailout,

105
which was partly reinstated later.

several senators told him

 Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation.
