for overhauling agricultural trade

 that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.

 The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire 
5005
span

6
to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products.
5
elaboration-object-attribute-e

7
 But it would allow considerable flexibility
5007
span

8
 in determining how and when these goals would be achieved.

9
 The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade 
5009
span

10
by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs
5010
span

11
 that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.

 it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners.

 seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan 
5016
span

19
that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000,
18
elaboration-object-attribute-e

20
 said 
5017
span

21
the new U.S. proposal wouldn't put farmers out of business
5020
Contrast

22
 but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants.

23
 The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva,
5022
span

24
 hoping 
5024
attribution

25
that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules
5024

26
 before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.

27
 Another U.S. proposal 
5026
span

28
filed Monday 
27
elaboration-additional-e

29
urges more fair play in services trade,
5057
span

30
 including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.
29
example-e

31
 Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal
5030
span

32
 which struck European countries as too extreme,
31
elaboration-additional-e

33
 the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.
5032
span

34
 For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear 
5034
attribution

35
there would be a transition period 
5034
span

36
during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas
5035
span

37
 to cushion their farmers from foreign competition. 
36
purpose

38
It also says
5038
attribution

39
 countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products 
5038
span

40
if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
39
condition

41
 Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, 
5040
span

42
as the earlier U.S. proposal did, 
41
comparison

43
the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones. 
5041
span

44
Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints,
5043
List

45
 and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.
5043
List

46
 The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures
5045
span

47
 to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules 
5046
span

48
to impede trade arbitrarily.
47
purpose

49
 The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one
5048
span

50
 prompted by the European Community's current attempt
5049
span

51
 to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle.

52
 The U.S. contends
53

53
 that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.
5051
span

54
 To encourage more competition among exporting countries,
5053
span

55
 the U.S. is proposing
5054
span

56
 that export subsidies, 
5055
span

57
including tax incentives for exporters,
56
example-e

58
 be phased out in five years.
