 California legislators,

searching for ways

to pay for the $4 billion to $6 billion in damages from last week's earthquake,

elaboration-object-attribute-e

4
 are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.
5002
span

5
 The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question 
5005
span

6
of how much the federal government is willing to spend 
5004
span

7
to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.
6
purpose-e

8
 The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief,
5009
concession

9
 but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure 
5009
span

10
calling for $2.85 billion in aid,
5008
span

11
 the bulk of which would go to California, with an unspecified amount
5007
span

12
 going to regions 
5006
span

13
affected by Hurricane Hugo.
12
elaboration-object-attribute-e

14
 That leaves the state roughly $2 billion to $4 billion short. 
5083
span

15
A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry.
5038
span

16
 According to the state department of finance, 
17
attribution

17
a one-penny increase in the state's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion.
5015
span

18
 Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said 
19
attribution

19
that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks.
5016
span

20
 California's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money 
5017
span

21
and so drastically limits its options in an emergency.
20
consequence-s

22
 Both Mr. Brown, the state's most influential legislator, and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase 
5019
span

23
-- should more money be needed 
5018
span

24
than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government.

25
 According to a spokesman, 
5021
attribution

26
the governor is also studying the possibility 
5021
span

27
of raising state gasoline taxes.
26
elaboration-object-attribute-e

28
 Mr. Brown, meanwhile, believes 
5023
attribution

29
only one tax will be feasible,
5023
List

30
 and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase, 
5023
List

31
said Chuck Dalldorf, an aide.
5022

32
 One immediate source of money is an emergency fund 
5025
span

33
set up by Gov. Deukmejian. 
32
elaboration-additional-e

34
The fund has about $1 billion 
5028
List

35
and is set up 
5026
span

36
to handle precisely the kind of emergency 
5027
span

37
the state faces, 
36
elaboration-object-attribute-e

38
said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.
5028
attribution

39
 But the fund's size is disputed by Mr. Brown's office,
5033
span

40
 which estimates 
41
attribution

41
the fund holds from $630 million to $800 million.
5030
span

42
 Moreover, an aide to Mr. Brown said 
5031
attribution

43
Gov. Deukmejian has expressed a desire 
5031
span

44
not to spend all the reserve on this.
43
elaboration-object-attribute-e

45
 To push through a sales tax increase, however, 
5043
question-answer-s

46
the state will have to suspend the Gann limit,
5043
span

47
 citing an emergency. 
46
means

48
And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period 
5045
span

49
after the temporary tax increase ends,
48
temporal-after

50
 said Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance.
5056
attribution

51
 A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state's legislature.
5047
span

52
 But observers expect broad support.
5059
span

53
 If there's an emergency 
5048
List

54
and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere,
5048
List

55
 I think 
56
attribution

56
the attitude will be supportive, 
5049
span

57
said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.
5050
attribution

58
 But others think 
59
attribution

59
property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.
5061
span

60
 Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback 
5063
span

61
as a result of a state ballot initiative 
5062
span

62
known as Proposition 13.
61
elaboration-object-attribute-e

63
 The state could also increase gasoline taxes; 
5064
span

64
every one penny increase in the tax would yield $11 million a month.
63
elaboration-general-specific

65
 But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything 
5065
span

66
to harm the state's chances 
5066

67
of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis.

72
 But some fear 
73
attribution

73
imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure. 
5071

74
 Not everyone is convinced

the state must raise new revenue 
5076

 It's possible, though not probable, that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help,
