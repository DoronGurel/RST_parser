 The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan

 When Attack hit the shelves in 1987,

P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.

 While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products,

 the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market,

span

32
 where growth is slow

and liquids have gained prominence over powders. 
5032

34
The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name

 With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more;

38
 many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine,

 And retailers are expected to embrace the product,

 When shelf space was cheap,

 bigger was better,

 If the new Cheer sells well,

 the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate
