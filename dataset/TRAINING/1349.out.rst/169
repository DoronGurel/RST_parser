 The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration,

 By a 26-7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative,

 The measure is expected to come before the House today,

 Given California's size and political importance,

 But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued

 Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans,

52
no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.

53
 A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style

55

 When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan,

Mr. Whitten insisted

 More important than money in many cases are waivers

California is seeking on current restrictions

 A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator, Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments
