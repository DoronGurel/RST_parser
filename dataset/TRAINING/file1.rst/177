1
 Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade,
5001
concession

2
 but it has not been sufficiently effective,
5001
span

3
 because, unfortunately, it came too late.
2
explanation-argumentative

4
 Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador,
5004
span

5
 of which my brother Guillermo was editor,
4
elaboration-additional-e

6
 began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations
5003
span

7
 to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.
6
elaboration-object-attribute-e

8
 Then,
5008
Same-Unit

9
 when it would have been easier to resist them,
5006
concession-e

10
 nothing was done 
5006
span

11
and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago.
10
consequence-s

12
 The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's.
5011
span

13
 The censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination.
12
means

14
 In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced forever, murdered.
5013
List

15
 Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota,
5051
span

16
 destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.
15
cause

17
 And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed,
5052
span

18
 and its installations destroyed.
17
cause

19
 Journalists and their families are constantly threatened 
5015
List

20
as are the newspaper distribution outlets.
5015
List

21
 Distribution centers are bombed,
5016
List

22
 and advertisers are intimidated.
5016
List

23
 Censorship is imposed by terrorism.
5019
restatement

24
 If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship
5023
condition

25
 there is little doubt
5023
span

26
 that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers
5022
span

27
 published in the free world.
26
elaboration-object-attribute-e

28
 The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way 
5025
span

29
press freedom can survive.
28
elaboration-object-attribute-e

30
 The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace
5028
span

31
 drugs posed to the moral structure of their country.
30
elaboration-object-attribute-e

32
 Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.
5031
span

33
 I can attest
5030
span

34
 that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
33
attribution

35
 Colombia alone 
5034
span

36
-- its government, its people, its newspapers--
35
elaboration-general-specific-e

37
does not have the capacity
5033
span

38
 to fight this battle successfully.
37
elaboration-object-attribute-e

39
 All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.
5036
span

40
 The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort.
39
elaboration-general-specific

41
 Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.
5037
interpretation-s

42
 Much is being done in Colombia
5039
span

43
 to fight the drug cartel mafia.
42
purpose

44
 Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities,
5040
List

45
 and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized.
5040
List

46
 More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports,
5041
List

47
 and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated.
5041
List

48
 The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel.
5042
List

49
 Much has been accomplished 
5044
span

50
and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army 
49
elaboration-additional

51
-- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured.
5045
span

52
 There has been a lot of talk
5047
span

53
 that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money.
52
elaboration-object-attribute-e

54
 In my opinion, this is not true.
5058
span

55
 Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate,
5050
span

56
 creating serious problems for low-income people 
5049
span

57
who aspire to own their own homes.
56
elaboration-object-attribute-e

58
 Drug money has also gone
5054
span

59
 to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs
5053
span

60
 where drugs are consumed.
59
elaboration-object-attribute-e

61
 But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.
5056
span

62
 In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.
61
elaboration-additional

63
 What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia 's legitimate products.
5059
span

64
 The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level
5060
span

65
 (after inflation)
64
elaboration-object-attribute-e

66
 since the Great Depression.
5061
Same-Unit

67
 Market conditions point to even lower prices next year.
5061
elaboration-additional

68
 The 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer.
69
consequence-n

69
 As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million less from its coffee this year than last.
5064
span

70
 Our coffee growers face reductions in their income,
71
consequence-n

71
 and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee.
5065
span

72
 U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export
5066
span

73
 -- cut flowers --
72
elaboration-general-specific-e

74
 into the American market.

Same-Unit

75
 A just price and an open market

5069
Same-Unit

78
 I take advantage of this opportunity 
5076
span

79
given to me by The Wall Street Journal
78
elaboration-object-attribute-e

80
 to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper,
5077
span

81
 to become soldiers 
5075
span

82
dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.
81
elaboration-object-attribute-e

83
 Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world
5079
span

84
 who fight this terrible scourge.
83
elaboration-object-attribute-e

85
 A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative.
